{"name":"Varp","tagline":"Variability Analysis and Resolution Plugin","body":"## [Variability Analysis and Resolution Plugin (VARP)](http://robotics-unibg.github.com/VARP/)\r\n\r\nVARP is a collection of Eclipse plugins that support the development of robotics software product lines, a family of similar applications that are built reusing a set of software components and share the same architecture. The SPL life cycle consists in three main phases: domain analysis, product line development, and product derivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Domain Analysis\r\n\r\nVARP provides a tool for the analysis and the modeling of the variability in terms of a Feature Model.\r\n\r\n### Product line Development\r\n\r\nVARP has been integrated with [BRIDE](http://www.best-of-robotics.org/bride/), wihch allows the design of software product line architectures for ROS and Orocos.\r\n\r\nVARP provides a tool for defining variability resolution patterns.\r\n\r\n### Product Derivation\r\n\r\nVARP provides a tool for selecting the desired functionalities of an application and automatically generating its architectural model.\r\n\r\n## How to install the Plugin\r\n\r\nThe plugin can be installed from source (by accessing the [github repository](https://github.com/Robotics-UniBG/VARP)) or by means of the [update site](http://www.best-of-robotics.org/varp/update_site/).\r\n\r\nIn order to install the plugin from source you need to setup the following environment:\r\n\r\n* [Eclipse Modeling Tools](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-modeling-tools/junosr1)\r\n* with the Graphical Modeling Tooling [update site](http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/gmp/gmf-tooling/updates/releases/) \r\n\r\n\r\n## Developers\r\n\r\nLuca Gherardi (luca dot gherardi at unibg dot it), University of Bergamo.\r\n\r\nSupervisor: Davide Brugali, University of Bergamo.\r\n\r\n## More information\r\n\r\nMore information can be found on the following papers:\r\n\r\n* L.
