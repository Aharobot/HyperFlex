## [HyperFlex Toolchain](http://robotics-unibg.github.com/HyperFlex/)

HyperFlex is a collection of Eclipse plugins that support the development of robotics software product lines, a family of similar applications that are built reusing a set of software components and share the same architecture. 

HyperFlex provides a set of tools for designing variability models and architectural models for the most spread Robotics Software Frameworks (ROS, Orocos and the cloud-based Rapyuta).


More information on the plugins and the installation can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/Robotics-UniBG/HyperFlex/wiki)

## Developers

Luca Gherardi (lucagh at ethz dot ch), Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control, ETH Zurich.

In collaboration with Davide Brugali, Department of Engineering, University of Bergamo.
