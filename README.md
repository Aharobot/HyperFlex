### Feature Models Plugin

The Feature Models Plugin allows the user to design Feature Models by means of a graphical editor.

Feature models were proposed for the first time in 1990 in the context of the Feature Oriented Domain Analysis (FODA) approach. FODA aims to identify the properties and the functionality of a software, which are commonly present in applications of a specific domain, and separate them in two groups: those that are always present (stable point) and those that are present only in some applications (variation points and their variants). For representing these properties and functionality FODA proposes a formal method: the feature model. 

### How to install the Plugin

The plugin can be installed from source (by accessing the [github repository](https://github.com/Robotics-UniBG/FeatureModels) ) or by means of the [update site](robotics-unibg.github.com/FeatureModels/update_site).

In order to install the plugin from source you need to setup the following environment:

* [Eclipse Modeling Tools](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-modeling-tools/junosr1)
* with the Graphical Modeling Tooling [update site](http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/gmp/gmf-tooling/updates/releases/)
